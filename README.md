# MyFS - Simple File System in Userspace

## Project Description

MyFS is a simple file system implemented in userspace using C++. The file system operates using a simulator that mimics the three abstraction layers of a typical file system (VFS, FileSystem, and Device Block). This project completes the simulator by implementing the missing components for handling files, directories, and basic file operations in a Linux environment.
